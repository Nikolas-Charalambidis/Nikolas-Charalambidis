### Hi there, I'm Nikolas

I'm currently in love with Java and everything around microservices architecture including Docker an automation. So I try to automate most of my repositories or at least include a simple CI pipeline. I would like to get more familiar with React or Angular, however, my heart sticks with backend.

I'm looking for a well-maintained and documented open-source project to contribute in my spare time.
